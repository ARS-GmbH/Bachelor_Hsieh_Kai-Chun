# Clever-Lab AI Framework, an extremely flexible AI framework for autonomous observation on long-running laboratory experiments

Author: Hsieh, Kai-Chun, [Munich University of Applied Science](https://www.hm.edu/)

## Content
During his internship at [ARS Computer und Consulting GmbH](https://www.ars.de/), Mr Kai-Chun Hsieh wrote his bachelor thesis about applying machine learning techniques to daily work in laboratories of the chemical and pharamceutical industry, in form of computer vision and classifying the taken images. It shows examples of how ML may help with the daily work and contains numerous examples.

This project contains a copy of his thesis as well as the code and data that were used with this.

## Abstract
Experiments with visual observation in scientific laboratories can take long time before recognizing effects. As salaries of laboratory staff have significant effect on cost calculation (up to $80/h) and waiting of the unknown result from combination of several chemical, physical or biological components would be boring and wasting time â€“ which means, meanwhile, wasting of pretty much money.

Under this circumstance, Machine Learning and Deep Learning may help.

However, among so many online and offline machine learning platforms, we found several problems: some of them having unclear pricing, some of them having bad performance, and some of them are hard to use. Especially, for data protection considerations, prohibit many companies the use of cloud-based services, although they provide often better user-experiences.

Considering AI and Machine Learning are too hard for scientific laboratorians to comprehensive, we would like therefore to build a machine learning framework, and the goal of which is to provide an APIlize platform, that is easy to use, open and comfortable to be extended, and convenient for users by saving their precious time.


## Technical notice
The sample notebook in video_capturer/ requires the ffmpeg binary to be installed which is used in a separate process to capture images. Read more about and download the executable from the projects web site at [https://ffmpeg.org/](https://ffmpeg.org/) .
